     * understands the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations, but for 
     * general use, a time-zone offset should be used: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 
     * 13:30:00 GMT+0430" (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich 
     * meridian). If no time zone is specified, the local time zone is 
     * assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent.
     * <p>
     * The string <tt>s</tt> is processed from left to right, looking for 
     * data of interest. Any material in <tt>s</tt> that is within the 
     * ASCII parenthesis characters <tt>(</tt> and <tt>)</tt> is ignored. 
     * Parentheses may be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted 
     * within <tt>s</tt> are these ASCII characters:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
     * ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
     * 0123456789,+-:/</pre></blockquote>
     * and whitespace characters.<p>
     * A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal 
     * number:<ul>
     * <li>If a number is preceded by <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> and a year 
     *     has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone 
     *     offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured 
     *     in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes, 
     *     expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A 
     *     preceding <tt>-</tt> means a westward offset. Time zone offsets 
     *     are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example, 
     *     <tt>-5</tt> occurring in the string would mean "five hours west 
     *     of Greenwich" and <tt>+0430</tt> would mean "four hours and 
     *     thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the 
     *     string to specify <tt>GMT</tt>, <tt>UT</tt>, or <tt>UTC</tt> 
     *     redundantly-for example, <tt>GMT-5</tt> or <tt>utc+0430</tt>.
     * <li>If a number is greater than 70, it is regarded as a year number. 
     *     It must be followed by a space, comma, slash, or end of string. 
     * <li>If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour, 
     *     unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is 
     *     regarded as a minute.
     * <li>If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month 
     *     (it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range <tt>0</tt> 
     *     to <tt>11</tt>), unless a month has already been recognized, in 
     *     which case it is regarded as a day of the month.
     * <li>If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or 
     *     end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a 
     *     minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has 
     *     been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second; 
     *     otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month. </ul><p>
     * A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated 
     * as follows:<ul>
     * <li>A word that matches <tt>AM</tt>, ignoring case, is ignored (but 
     *     the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less 
     *     than <tt>1</tt> or greater than <tt>12</tt>).
     * <li>A word that matches <tt>PM</tt>, ignoring case, adds <tt>12</tt> 
     *     to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been 
     *     recognized or is less than <tt>1</tt> or greater than <tt>12</tt>).
     * <li>Any word that matches any prefix of <tt>SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, 
     *     WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY</tt>, or <tt>SATURDAY</tt>, ignoring 
     *     case, is ignored. For example, <tt>sat, Friday, TUE</tt>, and 
     *     <tt>Thurs</tt> are ignored.
     * <li>Otherwise, any word that matches any prefix of <tt>JANUARY, 
     *     FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, 
     *     OCTOBER, NOVEMBER</tt>, or <tt>DECEMBER</tt>, ignoring case, and 
     *     considering them in the order given here, is recognized as
     *     specifying a month and is converted to a number (<tt>0</tt> to 
     *     <tt>11</tt>). For example, <tt>aug, Sept, april</tt>, and 
     *     <tt>NOV</tt> are recognized as months. So is <tt>Ma</tt>, which 
     *     is recognized as <tt>MARCH</tt>, not <tt>MAY</tt>.
     * <li>Any word that matches <tt>GMT, UT</tt>, or <tt>UTC</tt>, ignoring 
     *     case, is treated as referring to UTC. 
     * <li>Any word that matches <tt>EST, CST, MST</tt>, or <tt>PST</tt>, 
     *     ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the time zone in 
     *     North America that is five, six, seven, or eight hours west of 
     *     Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches <tt>EDT, CDT, 
     *     MDT</tt>, or <tt>PDT</tt>, ignoring case, is recognized as 
     *     referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight 
     *     saving time.</ul><p>
